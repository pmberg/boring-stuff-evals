# My Thoughts on Searchability

Much work within AI evals has been done on preventing an Internet search from returning answers to the problems. While some basic-level work will be done along those lines in this case (e.g. changing the stated values in a problem), this is inherently limited given that these problems are derived from a notable book published under a Creative Commons license. 

However, the philosophy of this package is that it is not intended to test the theoretical capability of an AI system in some sense where it is being compared to a person without Internet access. Rather, it is designed to measure capability on real-world tasks performed by non-programmers or novice programmers, and in the real world, a person would have Internet access. As such, effective use and compilation of available Internet resources is part of what is being evaluated here. Additionally, note that in practice, many real-world problems are very capable of being Internet searched for solutions, and "Google fu" is a real skill that an AI could assist a person with.
