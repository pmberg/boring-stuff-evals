# Roadmap for Development

Development for this project is based on the book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart. Many of the tests will be based on worked examples and exercises in the book. However, modifications will be made to prevent a direct Internet search from being able to return answers.

# Topics for Evaluations

## Basics

Basic operations, conditionals, loops, functions, data types, string/list/tuple/dictionary manipulations, and simple debugging associated with those. Largely recreating work from existing evals packages.

## Regular Expressions

Tasks involving the use of regular expressions (regexes) to accomplish goals of practical utility. Both involving generating regexes for specific tasks, and writing larger programs that use regexes as a key element.

## File Manipulations

Tasks based on reading and writing large numbers of files using Python libraries, using libraries to handle paths as well as reading/writing libraries.

## More

Based on Chapters 11 and onwards of Automate the Boring Stuff.
