# List of Regular Expression Evaluations

This will be a list of evaluations for the ability of AI to create and manipulate regular expressions in Python programs. This is based on Chapter 9 of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python.

1. Write a regex that matches phone numbers in a given format.
2. Write a regex that matches phone numbers in a range of possible formats.
3. Write a regex that matches email addresses.
4. Write a function that looks through a multi-line string, or list of one-line strings, for the above.
5. Answer each of the 19 practice questions in "Automate the Boring Stuff" Chapter 9.
6. Implement the strip() string method as a function using regexes.
7. Detect whether a password is strong based on the "Automate the Boring Stuff" Chapter 9 criteria.
8. That, but specify to the user which criteria are not met if they are not met.
9. Any more evaluations that I may brainstorm over the course of implementing these.
